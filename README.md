# Railway-Fish-Plate-Monitoring-System

Railway monitoring is top concern to avoid tremendous accidents. Accidents generally occurs due to derailment of train from the track. One of the serious reason of derailment of train is losing alignment of trails at fishplate .So, monitoring fishplate alignment and bolt position is required to ensure railway safety and security. In this study, an IOT based railway fishplate monitoring system has been proposed. The system keeps track of position of every bolt of fishplate and alert nearest station as well as central railway monitoring center if any bolt gets loosen. This system is ready to work where just 2G network is available. GSM module with 2G SIM has been used to communicate nearest station and central railway monitoring center which ensure availability of the system. In this paper Electric Pulse Generator(EPG) has been proposed which converts rotation of bolts in electrical pulse.It is very novel and quite efficient to detect rotation of bolts.
